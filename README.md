# courses
This directory contains a set of directories for each courses, book, project, etc that I want to try out certain concepts with.
So far the directories pertain to: 

  - a set algorithm courses taught by Tim Roughgarden from Stanford taken through coursera - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms
  - code inspired by the book Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus. 
  
  As with most things, the best way to learn is re-do things other people have done, and this directory is meant to contain 
  small implementations to test particular concepts.
