# algorithms_course

This directory contains a hodge-podge of code written in conjuction with a set of courses on algorithms taught by Tim Roughgarden offered by Stanford through Coursera. The specialization can be viewed here: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms

So far the dictory contains algorithms that perform:

    - the merge sort algorithm for sorting lists
    - integer multiplication
