# algorithms_course

This directory contains a hodge-podge of code written in conjuction with a set of courses on algorithms taught by Tim Roughgarden offered by Stanford through Coursera. The specialization can be viewed here: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms

For course 1 the following algorithms were coded as part of assignments :

    - assignment1: integer multiplication including Karatsuba multiplication
    - assignment2: mergesort 
    - assignment3: quicksort
    - assignment4: Karger min-cut algorithm for cutting graphs
